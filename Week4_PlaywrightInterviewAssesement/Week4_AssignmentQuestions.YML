   A:    To handle the alert in Playwright, There are two ways 
  page.once event
  page.on event

  page.on:
  =========

  in the test cases will be handled
  3. If alert is not handled , it will auto dismiss
  
  page.once:
  ========

  2. If used whenever the alert appeared in the application, it is handled the first alert alone
  3. If alert is not handled, it will auto dismiss

  methods:
  ========
  accept() --> Accept the alert
  dismiss() --> dismiss the alert
  message() --> display the message of the alert
  type() --> Displays the type of the alert

2.How would your code react if the alert is not handled?

3.How do you simulate both accept and cancel flows?

    Get the type of the alert and based on the type provide the condition inside the listener event

    ex:
    page.on("handling alert actions", async alert =>{

          const type = dialog.type()

          if(type === "confirm"){
          alert.accept()
          }
          else {
          alert.dismiss()
          }
    })

Window handling questions

1. How would you handle multiple pages/tabs?
   By using event listner, for single tab we can create the promise and click on the link and resolve
   the promise.

   using promise.all for multiple tabs are opened , we create array for the promise and store all the tabs insideit
